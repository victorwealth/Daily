A simple and single purpose application to store your daily task.

CREDIT: Gordon Zhu. HTML and CSS comes from Gordon's VanillaJS example.

After completing Gordon's tutorial on beginner JS, I decided to apply lessons and skills learned.
So I clone his html and css, then wrote the JS by myself referring to his lessons until I achieved most of the features.

I went a step further by storing list entered on user browser using JS API localForage. This makes the list available even when the browser is closed. User can continue from where they stopped the next time they open their browser.

I also re-branded the interface and changed the color scheme to my preferred color

The next feature is to make the app run offline (without the internet).
While I would have loved to include new features like reminders, I want the app to maintain it's simplicity. 

JS code is written by a beginner and have not been refactored. I want to keep every version of it as I continue to develop my JS skills, so I can see my progress as I conitnue to improve on my JS skills.
